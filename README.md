# kobold-benchmark

A dumb and small benchmarking script for KoboldCPP. It's not very good, but it's better than nothing.

> EDIT: I made this about 8 months ago as I publish this, so don't ask me about the code ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜­

## Usage

1. Copy `config.default.mjs` to `config.mjs` and edit it to your liking. Don't forget to put a proper prompt in there.
2. Run `node benchmark.mjs` to start the benchmark.
3. Results will be under results/ in the current directory, in an HTML file.
